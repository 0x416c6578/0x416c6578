Hi! I'm Alex, I'm a backend software engineer in the secure aerospace domain.

I have a small website [0x416c6578.github.io](https://0x416c6578.github.io) which contains various brain dumps and writeups on stuff I do.

I have professional experience with the following:
- Java microservices, Spring Boot + Spring WebFlux
- OpenAPI
- AWS

I have non-professional interests including:
- Hardware hacking, embedded software development
- Networking (in the computers-taking-to-each-other sense)
- Home automation (Home Assistant)
- Running
- Bouldering
