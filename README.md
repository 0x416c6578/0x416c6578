## Alex (0x416c6578)
Hi! I'm Alex, a backend software engineer working within the aerospace and navigation domains. I have extensive experience writing backend microservice applications in Java (Spring Boot, Spring WebFlux, Project Reactor), data analysis in Python and cloud technologies (specifically AWS - MSK, EKS, ECR, and various other common services like S3, EC2 etc.).

My current programming interests include:
- Learning the Go programming language (it's _very cool_)
- Learning the basics of frontend development (Typescript + Angular)

My interests outside of backend stuff include hardware hacking, embedded software development, 3D printing and home automation with Home Assistant.

Projects TODO List:
- Build an API in Go for querying the Koreader reading statistics database (https://github.com/koreader/koreader/blob/master/plugins/statistics.koplugin/main.lua)
- Build a basic frontend application in Angular that will query that API and present information and visualisations of reading statistics
